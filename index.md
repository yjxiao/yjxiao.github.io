### About Me
&nbsp;

I'm a fourth year Ph.D. Student in the [UCSB NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu) advised by [Professor William Y. Wang](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/). My research interests are natural language processing and deep learning. More specifically, I'm interested in Bayesian deep learning, uncertainty estimation, deep generative models and their applications.

I received my M.S. in Data Science from [NYU](https://cds.nyu.edu) in 2016. I also hold a Bachelor's from Tsinghua University and a Master's degree from UC Davis both in Civil Engineering.
